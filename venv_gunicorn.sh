# Utility script for starting gunicorn
# ------------------------------------
# This script is particularly useful as a command target in a Supervisor
# configuration. While Supervisor can handle activating a virtualenv, it's not
# very elegant. Here we can do everything we need to get gunicorn and django
# up and running.
